#This example demonstrates the multiple assignment shorthand for python variables.
#Align the variables you'd like to assign in an order that corresponds with the position in the list
#You'd like to draw from and set it equal to cat. However, the number of variables assigned must be 
#equal to the length of the list
# ex. 
# cat = ["fat", "orange", "loud", "ugly"]
# size, color, disposition = cat
#
#will give you an error 
cat = ["fat", "orange", "loud", "ugly"]
size, color, disposition, appearance = cat
print (size, color, disposition, appearance)
